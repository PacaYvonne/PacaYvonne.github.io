                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., about 10% to 20% are </span><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/hypoallergenic-dogs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allergic to dogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Having allergies can be a real challenge for dog lovers who wish to enjoy the company of their dog. However, there's no need to worry because there are specific breeds that are hypoallergenic, making them perfect for those who suffer from dog allergies. Hypoallergenic dogs produce fewer allergens such as dander, saliva, and urine proteins than other breeds, which reduces the risk of allergic reactions. It's important to note that hypoallergenic dogs aren't entirely allergen-free, but their low-shedding coats and minimal dander make them a better fit for people with allergies.</span></p>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Does Hypoallergenic Mean?</span></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk about the best hypoallergenic dogs, we're referring to breeds that produce fewer allergens than other breeds. However, it's important to note that no dog breed is completely hypoallergenic or allergen-free. Still, hypoallergenic breeds are known for producing fewer allergens such as dander, saliva, and urine proteins. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets hypoallergenic breeds apart from others is their compatibility with individuals who have allergies. These breeds typically have certain characteristics that make them more suitable for people who suffer from allergies. For example, many hypoallergenic dogs have coats that shed minimally or not at all. This means fewer loose hairs and dander, which are common allergens. Additionally, some hypoallergenic breeds have specific coat types, such as curly or wiry coats, which tend to trap loose hair and dander, preventing them from spreading as much as with other breeds. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, certain breeds may produce lower levels of allergenic proteins in their saliva or skin oils, which can also contribute to fewer allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. So, if you're someone who suffers from allergies but still wants a furry companion, hypoallergenic breeds may be a good option for you</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portuguese Water Dogs are considered one of the best hypoallergenic dog breeds due to their </span><a href="https://usspwdc.org/so-you-want-a-pwd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single coat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, minimal shedding, and dander, thanks to their single-layered waterproof coat.
