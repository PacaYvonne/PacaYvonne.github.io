                <p>For many people, the cuteness of a cat can be too hard to resist. I mean, who can blame them! However, for those with cat allergies, choosing the right breed is crucial. The worst cats for allergies are those that trigger a stronger allergic reaction compared to others. In this guide, we’ll explore the worst cat breeds for those with cat allergies, helping you make an informed decision about which breeds to avoid if you’re sensitive to Fel d 1, the major cat allergen and main culprit of your sneezes and sniffles. </p>
                <p>P.S. If you’re someone with mild cat allergies looking to adopt a cat, take a look at our list of the <a href="https://pacagen.com/blogs/cat-allergies/what-are-the-best-cat-breeds-for-allergies">best cats for people with cat allergies</a>.</p>
                <h2>What Causes Cat Allergies? </h2>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, cat allergies aren’t caused by a cat’s fur, but by a protein called Fel d 1. This protein is found in cats’ saliva, skin, and urine. When cats groom themselves, Fel D1 protein in their saliva sticks to their fur and becomes airborne when they shed. </p>
                <p>With this in mind, there are 3 factors that determine a cat’s potential to trigger allergies. </p>
                <ol>
                <li>
                <b>Fur Length</b>: The longer a cat’s fur, the more likely it is to trap Fel d 1, which means relatively more Fel d 1 becomes airborne when they shed. Long cat fur is one of the more common features amongst the worst cats for allergies. </li>
                <li>
                <b>Grooming and Shedding Frequency:</b> Some cats groom themselves more, which leads to more Fel d 1 being deposited onto their fur. Cats who shed more also increase the likelihood of Fel d 1 being spread around, thereby amplifying the potential of an allergic reaction.</li>
                <li>
                <b>Fel d 1 Production</b>: Some cat breeds produce slightly more Fel d 1, such as Himalayan cats, while <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4072467/">other breeds produce less</a>, such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5753643/">Siberian</a> cats. However, there is significant individual variation.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Top 8 Worst Cat Breeds for Allergies</h2>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/Persian-cat-2.webp" alt="Persian cat looking at screen" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>Persian Cats</h3>
                <p>The Persian cat is known to be one of the cat breeds that shed the most frequently. On top of that, Persian cats blow their coat twice a year, meaning they shed their entire coat at once, releasing large amounts of Fel d 1.</p>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/Oriental-longhair.jpg" alt="Oriental longhair cat" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>Oriental Longhair Cats</h3>
                <p>As the name suggests, Oriental Longhairs have long fur, which traps significant Fel d 1. These cats also frequently groom themselves, increasing the amount of Fel d 1 that gets trapped and released.</p>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/British-longhair.jpg" alt="British longhair cat" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>British Longhair Cats</h3>
                <p>Similar to the Oriental Longhair, the British Longhair has long, thick fur, which traps relatively more Fel d 1 than other breeds. British Longhairs also shed very often, making them not ideal for those with severe cat allergies.</p>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/Birman-cat.jpg" alt="Birman cat" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>Birman Cats</h3>
                <p>Though Birman cats only shed a moderate amount relative to other cats, their fur is thick and long, which does a great job at trapping Fel d 1. When they do shed, all of this trapped Fel d 1 is released.</p>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/Himalayan_cat.jpg" alt="Himalayan cat" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>Himalayan Cats</h3>
                <p>Himalayan cats produce more Fel d 1 compared to other breeds. They are also heavy shedders, making them among the worst cats for allergies.</p>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/Cymric-cat.jpg" alt="Cymric cat" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>Cymric Cats</h3>
                <p>A variation of the Manx cat, Cymric cats are very recognizable because they lack a tail. Cymric cats also have very long coats, which traps a lot of Fel d 1. They only shed moderately, so they may still pose a risk for cat allergy sufferers.</p>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/Maine-Coon.jpg" alt="Maine coon" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>Maine Coon Cats</h3>
                <p>Despite Maine Coons having shorter or similar length fur compared to some of the other breeds on this list, they shed very often. Their elevated shedding frequency combined with their size means that there is higher potential for Fel d 1 to trigger allergic reactions.</p>
                <div style="text-align: start;"><img src="/assets/images/Scottish-fold.jpg" alt="Scottish fold" style="float: none;"></div>
                <h3>Scottish Fold</h3>
                <p>Scottish Folds have an average shedding frequency, but their coats are extremely thick. This thick coat acts similarly to the other long-haired cats on this list, trapping large amounts of Fel d 1.</p>
                <h3>Are Tabby Cats Hypoallergenic?</h3>
                <p>Many people wonder, "are tabby cats hypoallergenic?" The answer is no. Tabby refers to a coat pattern, not a specific breed of cats. Tabby cats can be found in various breeds including some of the worst cats for allergies mentioned above.</p>
                <h2>Managing Cat Allergies: Beyond Breed Selection</h2>
                <p>If you're determined to have a feline companion despite allergies, consider the following strategies to minimize cat allergens and Fel d 1:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Regular Grooming: Brush your cat frequently to reduce shedding and the spread of Fel d 1.</li>
                <li>Air Purifiers: Use HEPA air purifiers to remove airborne allergens. This should not replace cleaning or grooming altogether.</li>
                <li>Cat Allergen Neutralizing Sprays: Our <a href="https://pacagen.com/products/cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack">Cat Allergen Neutralizing Spray</a> breaks down Fel d 1 proactively in the air and on surfaces providing you with rapid and fast relief in hours to days. </li>
                <li>Specialized Cat Food: Some specialized diets can reduce Fel d 1 production such as Purina Live Clear. Pacagen’s <a href="http://alendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week/2024/7/3?pli=1">Cat Food Topper</a> can be added to any diet and features the same allergen-neutralizing technology as our Cat Allergen Neutralizing spray working hard to tackle cat allergens at their source. </li>
                <li>Allergy Medications: Consult your doctor about antihistamines or other treatments for your cat allergies.</li>
                </ol>
