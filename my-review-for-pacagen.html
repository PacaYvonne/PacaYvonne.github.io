      <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong style="color:#c62828;">I've lived with cats for most of my life.</strong> At this point, the decision is settled: the cats are permanent.</p>
      <p>So when people suggest that "getting rid of the cat" is the solution to allergies, it doesn't land. It never has. My home is built around my cat — emotionally and practically. The goal has never been to eliminate him from my life, but to find a way to live comfortably together.</p>
      <p>For years, I've managed cat allergies the way many long-time cat owners do: quietly, consistently, and with a lot of effort. That's why I decided to try <a href="https://www.pacagen.com/products/cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray" class="productlink" target="_blank">Pacagen</a>.</p>

      <h2>Cleaning Became a Daily Defense System</h2>
      
      <p>If you live with cat allergies, you probably already know the routine.</p>
      <P>I vacuum constantly. I wipe down surfaces every day. I wash bedding more often than most people would consider normal.I run air purifiers. I’ve tried changing cat food. I’ve rotated antihistamines. I’ve made peace with certain limits.</P>
      <p><strong style="color:#c62828;">None of this was new or dramatic — just the cost of living with a cat I love.</strong></p>
      <p>Cleaning wasn’t about keeping the house spotless. It was about trying to stay ahead of allergens that always seemed to come back. No matter how thorough I was, the sneezing, itchy eyes, congestion, and poor sleep never fully disappeared. The allergies were manageable, but always present.</p>
      
      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="assets/images/chh_30days_2.png" alt="Image 1">
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Why Most Allergy Solutions Didn’t Fully Work</h2>
      <p>Antihistamines helped, but left me tired or foggy. Cleaning helped, but only temporarily. Lifestyle adjustments required constant vigilance. <strong style="color:#c62828;">What none of these approaches really addressed was the source of the problem. </strong>Cat allergies aren’t caused by fur itself, but by a protein found in cat saliva and dander. When cats groom themselves, that protein spreads onto their fur, furniture, and into the air we breathe. That’s what triggers the reactions.</strong></p>
      <p>No amount of surface cleaning ever fully stopped that cycle. So when a friend recommended <a href="https://www.pacagen.com/products/cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray" class="productlink" target="_blank">Pacagen</a>, I was cautious — but interested.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">What Made Me Try Pacagen</h2>
      <p>What caught my attention wasn’t marketing language or dramatic promises. <strong style="color:#c62828;">It was the science behind it.</strong></p>
      <p>Pacagen doesn’t just mask allergy symptoms or trap allergens in filters. Its proprietary WhiskerBlock™ technology is designed to target the source — breaking down the cat allergens that trigger allergic reactions in the environment. That approach made sense to me. Instead of managing reactions after the fact, it aimed to reduce the allergens before they became a problem.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">My Honest Experience After 30 Days</h2>
      <p>Before trying <a href="https://www.pacagen.com/products/cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray" class="productlink" target="_blank">Pacagen</a>, I assumed it would add yet another step to an already full routine. In reality, it didn't. It's a simple spray that I used on the areas my cat interacts with the most—my couch, bedding, rugs, and a few shared surfaces. <strong style="color:#c62828;">There was no strong scent, no complicated instructions, and no need to change how I already clean my home.</strong> It fit naturally into the routine I'd already built, which made it easy to use consistently without thinking about it.<p>
      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Easy to use from day one:</strong> It's a simple spray I used on the couch, bedding, rugs, and my cat's favorite spots. No strong scent, no complicated instructions. It layered naturally into my existing routine.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>After 3 days — less sneezing:</strong> I didn't notice a dramatic overnight change. Within the first three days, however, I realized I was sneezing less throughout the day. Symptoms weren't completely gone, but clearly reduced.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>After 10 days — fewer itchy eyes:</strong> The persistent eye itchiness—especially in the evenings—became noticeably less intense. This symptom usually lingered regardless of cleaning, so the change stood out.</li>
        <div class="row mt-3 mb-3">
          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
            <a href="https://www.pacagen.com/products/cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray" class="ctabutton" target="_blank">Breathe Easier With Pacagen</a>
          </div>
        </div>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>After 20 days — more restful sleep:</strong> I was finally sleeping through the night without waking up sneezing or struggling to breathe. A whole new level of comfort in my own home.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>After 30 days — living with my cat felt easy:</strong> The biggest change was how little I thought about my allergies. Sitting on the couch with my cat, I wasn't mentally tracking symptoms or planning my next cleaning cycle. Using Pacagen had simply become part of the background.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="assets/images/chh_30day_4.png" alt="Image 1">
    </div>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">What Pacagen Changed — and What It Didn’t</h2>
    <p>Pacagen didn’t force me to change my lifestyle. I still clean my home, but it no longer feels like I’m fighting a losing battle. The air feels calmer. My reactions are milder. And the mental load of constantly managing allergies has eased.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, it allowed my home to feel like a shared space again — not something I had to constantly control.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>If you are allergic to cats, Pacagen is exactly what you’re expecting. For me, it didn’t change my relationship with my cat.It just made living with him easier.</p>
